This is power sensor module with C language compile by Arduino IDE
-equipment
  1.Esp32
  2.ZMPT101b
  3.OLED
This module will publish stage of voltage from calculated voltage that sensor(ZMPT101b) detected. If voltage is lower than 90% of 220(nomal voltage input) or higher than 110% of 220 esp32 will publish volt stage that is equal to "0". If voltage do not meet any condition esp32 will publish volt stage that is equal to "1".
This module publish volt stage by title TOPIC_PREFIX/volt/stage please change TOPIC_PREFIX in config.h file before use it in any device.
you can add mqtt broker and wifi information in config.h file.

Thank you
